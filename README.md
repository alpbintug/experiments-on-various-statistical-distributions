# Experiments on various statistical distributions
MATLAB codes I wrote to compare Experimental versus Theoretical results of various distributions.
Included distributions are; Binomial, Exponential, Geometric, Normal, Poisson.

## Prerequisites

Codes are written in ***MATLAB 9.8***, to not encounter problems, use this version of MATLAB to run the codes.

## Installation and Running

- ***Clone*** the repository
- ***Import*** the codes into ***MATLAB R2020a***
- ***Change*** the main.m according to your needs
- ***Run*** the main from MATLAB console
